# Brian's Work Script
#
# TODO (Brian)
# 1a. make something to symlink all (or most) config files to a single file / single directory
# 1b. make something to undo it (git probably won't like the config thing)
# 2a. make a thing to scaffold components, probably with tabs, with some sed expressions
# 2b. potentially a small interface to read sed commands + apply them
# 2c. make a small menu / selector with the shit you want in your component / module
#
# Commenting out the entire script because I don't work here anymore, but the script might still
# be useful from the MS perspective. We'll see.
